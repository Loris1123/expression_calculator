This is just a very small project to learn Googles new language Go.
I got some code written in Eiffel from my informatics professor(http://karlheinz-hug.de/informatik/index.htm) and im going to tranlate it into Go.

This programm is able to calculate a mathematic expression and returns the result.
For the expression the parameters a,b,c and d can be used.
Example: 
./ExpressionCalculator -a=3 -b=2 -c=4.90 -d=34 -exp=a*b+(d-a)*c
